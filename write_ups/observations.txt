1). inaccuracy when drawing using pencil, on canvas 
about:- when i was trying to draw something on canvas using pencil , 
		it always had deviations like getting draw far from the point of click
		both horizontally and vartically.
observation:- when i removed the height: 100% and width 100% , it becomes accurate.
answer:-  setting height and width does not chang resolution causing the issue of 
			inaccuracy.
solution:- changed the canvas.style.width / height to canvas.width and height with window.innerWidth
			window.innerHeight removed the issue of inaccuracy, also removed the issue of pixilated draw.



2). when drawing square it was spawning as i drag  
about:- when i was trying to draw something on canvas using square , 
		it would run along the line , draws along the line.
observation:- was becuase i was drawing while dragging which was causing the issue
answer:-  started drawing after mouse event mouse up is triggered removed the issue.


3). Drawing Square?  
about:- how to draw a square using cordinates on a plane . 
observation:- i am using euclides formula with pythagores to get horizontal line to draw it.
issue:- i am getting a square but it is always away from the end of the mouse point.



3). Drawing Circle?  
about:- how to draw a circle using cordinates on a plane . 
observation:- i am using euclides formula to get distance between two points and using it as radius.
issue:- i am getting a circle but it is always away from the end of the mouse point

4). Working on undo ctrl + z?  
about:- undo Changes by ctrl +z , removed the rect using clearRect function. 
observation:-  issue is when i am ctrl +z it clears half of the rectangle and when i draw another rectangle it comes back.
issue:- it is not clearing the rectangle , clear not clearing all one issue was with inaccuracy of float removed by flooring the 
		floating point imprecision.
solution:- worked when i inceased the area and decreased the cordinates.


5). Working on undo ctrl + z?  
about:- undo Changes by ctrl +z , removed the rect using clearRect function . 
observation:- when i draw another rectangle it comes back.
solution:- worked, solution for this was using ctx.beiginPath() and ctx.closePath(), when we are not using ctx.beginPath()
			when ever stroke is called it redraws everything available in the memory stack meaning every drawing done without
			BEGIN PATH .
reference:- https://codetheory.in/why-clearrect-might-not-be-clearing-canvas-pixels/


6). Moving the drawing?  
about:- moving drawing on clicking the canvas or image. 
observation:- on click of mouse get the nearest drawing for moving.
solution:- creating priority que to get closest drawing using priority que from the cordinates.
			getting all the drawing from the history stack;

7).bug:- moving the drawing cretes new drawing?
about:- moving drawing from one place another creates new shape.
observation:- might be because i am not properly handling closing of one option.


8). Removing anything is possible now eraser is working
about:- remove in certain area
observation:- creating an area of 20 by default then adding moving and down event to mouse to achive moving erase.
